# 🔎 SIFT

### Stop Searching. Start Learning.

**SIFT cuts through Resource FOMO** — the hours students lose comparing playlists, courses, blogs, and roadmaps — and hands them the one resource that actually fits how they learn.

## 🧭 In One Line

> **SIFT asks five short questions, then tells you exactly where to learn — no more tabs, no more comparing, no more Resource FOMO.**

---

## 😩 The Problem: Resource FOMO

Before a student writes a single line of code, they've already lost an hour to a different kind of struggle:

- Which YouTube playlist is actually good?
- Which course is worth the time?
- Which documentation is beginner-friendly?
- Which roadmap should I trust?
- What does everyone on Reddit actually recommend?

This isn't learning. It's **research paralysis** — and it happens *before* the learning even starts. We call it **Resource FOMO**: the fear that whatever you pick, something better exists that you haven't found yet.

The tragedy is that the answer is almost always the same for people in the same situation — a beginner in web development with 5 hours a week and a visual learning style doesn't need to sift through 40 options. They need **one good one.**

---

## 💡 The Solution

SIFT replaces the search with a conversation.

Students answer a short questionnaire covering their **goal, experience level, learning style, weekly study time, and interests.** SIFT matches those answers against a curated resource database and returns the recommendation that fits — not the most popular one, not the loudest one, the *right* one.

```text
❌ Old way:  Open 12 tabs → compare → doubt yourself → repeat → give up → learn nothing
✅ SIFT way: Answer 5 questions → get your resource → start learning
```

Every step exists for one reason: to get the student from "I don't know where to start" to "I'm learning" as fast as possible.

---

## 🎯 The Recommendation Engine

This is the core of SIFT. Once a student submits the questionnaire, the engine:

1. Reads their **goal**, **experience level**, and **learning style**
2. Filters the curated database (`Resources.json`) by category and difficulty
3. Weighs matches against **weekly study time** and **interests**
4. Returns the single best-fit resource — not a list to sort through

> 💬 The goal isn't to give students *more* options. It's to give them the *right* one, so the decision is already made by the time they arrive.

## 🚀 Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/AyMi-2025/NYC_Contest.git

# Move into the project directory
cd NYC_Contest
```

No build step, no package manager required — SIFT runs on plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

---

## 🔥 Firebase Setup

1. Create a project at [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Enable **Email/Password Authentication** under **Build → Authentication → Sign-in method**
3. Copy your Firebase config object
4. Paste it into `js/firebase-config.js`:

```javascript
const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
  authDomain: "YOUR_AUTH_DOMAIN",
  projectId: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID",
  storageBucket: "YOUR_STORAGE_BUCKET",
  messagingSenderId: "YOUR_SENDER_ID",
  appId: "YOUR_APP_ID"
};
```

---

## 💻 Running Locally

```bash
# Option 1 — open directly
open index.html

# Option 2 — serve locally (recommended for Firebase auth to work correctly)
npx serve .
```

Then visit `http://localhost:3000` (or whichever port your server assigns).
